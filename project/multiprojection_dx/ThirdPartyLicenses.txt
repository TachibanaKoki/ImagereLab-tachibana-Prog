Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent
that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the
Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that
may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You
contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without
limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which
You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of
this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an
accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date
it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by
a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you
contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that
Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement
that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version
or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an
intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its
utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source
code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making
the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as
described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those
who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming
interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,
where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created
one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the
notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such
notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be
likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in
Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for
that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code
version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You
must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with
all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions. Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new versions
of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a
particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the
terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg
No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms
applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License
(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
phrases "FreeImage", `FreeImage Public License", "FIPL", or any confusingly
similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it
clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the
FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if
You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days
of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are
properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH
PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with
only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the The Netherlands:
(a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License
(excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be
subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs
of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in
Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall
be subject to the jurisdiction of the court of Almelo, The Netherlands with the
losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4,
You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your
utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of
Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing such
rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected parties to
distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.
